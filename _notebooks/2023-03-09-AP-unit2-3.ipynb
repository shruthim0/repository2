In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn't seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others.\n",

    "## 2.3 Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last name\n",
    "First name\n",
    "Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12)\n",
    "Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale)\n",
    "The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "First name\n",
    "Last name\n",
    "Number of absences from school\n",
    "Number of late arrivals to school\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: There will be many students at the school that share the same first name. Without a unique student ID, students with the same name may get confused with eachother. So if one student's GPA may get confused with anothers, which would cause the researcher's data and analysis to be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Combining multiple data sets requires the involved data sets to have similar structures and calculations. One county may calculate pollution in different units (per sq acre vs per sq mile) than another county. County datasets may also differ in the frequency of data present. One county may have data on pollution for every year, but onther county may conduct that reaseach monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Anytime when user's are able to manually type into a field, there is always a chance the data collected from that field has \"garbage\" in it. Users may spell the city name wrong, use an abbreviation, or use a city nickname. A more user friendly program would plan for events like there by, for example, not only having city names in their data, but also city abbreviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Name of artist performing at the show\n",
    "Date of show\n",
    "Total dollar amount of all tickets sold\n",
    "Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: The average proce of tickets would be the most helpful in determining the artist with the greatest attendence. The attendance for a specific show can be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of tickets sold by the average ticket price would give you how many people have bought tickets for that show.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Only a visual would show the number of bicycles the car passed. Neither the car’s speed, the date, time, or the car’s GPS location would be able to indicate the number of bicycles the care passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes) ?\n",
    "On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes) ?\n",
    "Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no) ?\n",
    "Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do?\n",
    "Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do?\n",
    "Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: Option 3 requires data outside of the survey, specifically the student' grades. Both I and II only require data from within the survey."
