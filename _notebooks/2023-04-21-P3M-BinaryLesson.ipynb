    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",

    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits? \n",

    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",

    "    56-16=40---> 2^40; \n",
    "    2^56/2^16= 2^40\n",
