### Week 0
- Downloading and Setting up Tools
- PowerShell
    - cd = change directory
    - cd ~ = change directory to home
    - ls = list files
    - code . = opens up VSCode
- Markdown
    - #,##,##-size of font
    - *italics*
    - **bold**
    - ~~strikethrough~~

### Week 1
- Python
    - print ("text") = will print what is in the quotes
    - def = used to define a function
    - import = imports a function
- Markdown
    - embed an image: use site.baseur 


### Unit 2 
- bits: the single unit of information in a computer, typically represented as a 0 or 1
- bytes: grouping of 8 bits
- hexadecimal/nibbles: numbering system with base 16
- binary numbers
    - unsigted integer: whole numbers) but have the property that they don't have a + or - sign associated with them. Thus they are always non-negative (zero or positive).
    - signed integer: A signed integer is a 32-bit datum that encodes an integer in the range [-2147483648 to 2147483647]
    - floating point: arithmetic that represents real numbers approximately, using an integer with a fixed precision, called the significand
- Binary Data Abstractions
    - Boolean: a value that is either true or false (1 or 0)
    - ASCII: a character encoding standard for electronic communication; diff symbols stand for different numbers; used 1 byte
    - Unicode: Unicode is a universal character encoding standard. This standard includes roughly 100000 characters to represent characters of different languages; used 4 bytes
    - RGB: color model based on red value, green value, and blue value.
- Data Compression: 
    - Lossy: Lossy compression reduces a file by permanently eliminating certain information, especially redundant information. When the file is uncompressed, some of the original information is not there, although the user may not notice it.
    - Lossless: Every bit of data originally in a file remains after it is uncompressed, and all the information is restored.


### Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms
- Variables: A value that can change, depending on conditions or on information passed to the program. A variable can be assigned to a certain integer, float, string...
- Data Types: a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing an error.
- Assignment Operators: sets and/or re-sets the value stored in the storage location(s) denoted by a variable name; in other words, it copies a value into the variable
- Managing Complexity with Variables
    - Lists: an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.
    - 2D Lists: 2D array is a collection of data cells, all of the same type, which can be given a single name
    - Dictionaries: an abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs 
    - Class: static variable that can be declared anywhere at class level with static
- Algorithms: a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem
- Sequence: the order in which statements are executed
- Selection: a programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met
- Iteration: when the same procedure is repeated multiple times.
- Expressions: a combination of values and functions that are combined and interpreted by the compiler to create a new value, as opposed to a “statement” which is just a standalone unit of execution and doesn't return anything
- Comparison Operators: >, <=, <, =>, ==... operators that compare
- Truth Tables: A truth table is a way of summarising and checking the logic of a circuit. The table shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce.
- Characters: a display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbo (char)
- Strings: A string is generally considered a data type and is often implemented as an array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding.
- Length: of a string
- Concatenation: combining 2 strings
- Traversing Strings: accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript
- Python If: a statement with an if condition
- Elif: else if statement, - if x is true then ___, else do ____
- Else conditionals: a statement with an else condition-- if x ____ else ____
- Nested Selection Statements: selection statements that are nested within themselves (see example)
- Python For While loops with Range: a for/while loop that uses the range() function
- Python for/while loop with with List: a while/for loop that iterates through a list and applies a certain algo to items in list
- Combining loops with conditionals to Break: For certain conditions, the loop will terminate exectution
- Python Def procedures (see code block 1)
- Parameters: values that are passed through a function
- Return Values: a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task
