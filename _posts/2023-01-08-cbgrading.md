| Program Purpose and Function | 0        | 0        | The student met the requirement because in their video they showed entering the input, the program is run, and the output is displayed. In their response, they clearly state the functionality and lists the inputs and outputs of the function. It DOES NOT state the purpose, only the what the function does. | yes            |
| Data Abstraction             | 1        | 1        | Includes code segment with a list and another segment where the code segment is being used.
