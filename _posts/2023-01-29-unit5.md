### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
1. Yes, the dopamine issue is real. Dopamine is the same neurotransmitter that is released in you body when you use drugs. That's how addiction is created. Your body requires more and more of that stimulant to reach that same level of dopamine from the first time. The same can be said for video games.

## 5.2

### What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
By creating contributions that advance the digital aspects of our world.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
At a school, there are certain restrictions that just must be in place. In this case, the risk, student's using the internet inappropriately is much higher that the reward of digital empowerment.

## What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.
The digital divide prevalent in our world takes away more opportunities from those who have less access to technology and overall make their lives harder. We can even see this at school, where if you don't have a smartphone you can't use the qr codes clubs use for google forms or websites.
