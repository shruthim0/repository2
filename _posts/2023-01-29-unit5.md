# Unit 5 

## 5.1

</br>
</br>


### Harms of our Project
1. Could lead to some overly watching their diet.
2. Discourages eating from restaurants. If this program was used VERY widely could hurt small food businesses.
3. Privacy issues when entering personal information into site
</br>

### Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
1. Yes, the dopamine issue is real. Dopamine is the same neurotransmitter that is released in you body when you use drugs. That's how addiction is created. Your body requires more and more of that stimulant to reach that same level of dopamine from the first time. The same can be said for video games.

## 5.2

### What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
By creating contributions that advance the digital aspects of our world.
2. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
At a school, there are certain restrictions that just must be in place. In this case, the risk, student's using the internet inappropriately is much higher that the reward of digital empowerment.

## What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others.
The digital divide prevalent in our world takes away more opportunities from those who have less access to technology and overall make their lives harder. We can even see this at school, where if you don't have a smartphone you can't use the qr codes clubs use for google forms or websites.

## 5.3
1. Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
Mostly the older generation uses Facebook while GenZ uses Tiktok. This is profitable for the individual companies as they are able to market goods to those specific groups.
2. Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
I think it's connected to the idea that women are supposed to be traditionally be the "caretakers" so when a virtual asistant has a female voice it may make people feel like they are being taken care of. Which people may believe that women have a more soothing voice then men.
3. Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google)
Netflix uses both user specific data and data from the general population, to keep users hooked on their platform. Like the "__% similar to your taste" category. 
4. HP Computer Video: When not enough diverse data is used to train a program, it results in bias. In the HP video, they probably only used white faces when training their facial recognition program, so the program is unusable to any non-white person.

## 5.4
1. CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
Our project is about providing users with recipes. So, we could have a page where people are able to "like" or vote up/down each recipe. This would get data on the opinions APCS students have about recipes.
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
Del Norte has diverse individuals with different backgrounds and views. By using DNHS as our population, we can collect diverse data.
3. What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
Our project is about providing users with recipes. So, we could have a page where people are able to "like" or vote up/down each recipe. This would get data on the opinions APCSP/APCSA students have about recipes.
