### How it went
Our presentation went well. I finished deployment that day and we connected our frontends and backends. I was able to show my program as well as my READ and POST methods.


### Improvements
The deployment process took a while and I was only able to bypass all the errors and finish an hour before our N@M slot. Next time I hope to start deployment sooner and run into fewer errors since I am now more familiar with the process.

### Other classes I saw

I got to watch 2 jazz band performances which were very entertaining. I could tell they put lots of practice time in to make sure they did their best on performance day.


I also saw some other csp projects. I saw a group who made a period tracker program which I thought was a great idea that has many benefits. Their individual parts included having an ovulation tracker, period tracker, a quiz about periods too.
