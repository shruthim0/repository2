### How it went
Our presentation went well. I finished deployment that day and we connected our frontends and backends. I was able to show my program as well as my READ and POST methods.


### Improvements
The deployment process took a while and I was only able to bypass all the errors and finish an hour before our N@M slot. Next time I hope to start deployment sooner and run into fewer errors since I am now more familiar with the process.

### Other classes I saw

1. I got to watch 2 jazz band performances which were very entertaining. I could tell they put lots of practice time in to make sure they did their best on performance day.

2. I saw a group that made a car website and their graphics were amazing.

3. Looked at the art station. So many of the pieces were so pretty and it amazed me how talented and creative so many people are.

4. I also saw some other csp projects. I saw a group who made a period tracker program which I thought was a great idea that has many benefits. Their individual parts included having an ovulation tracker, period tracker, a quiz about periods too. 

5. Us presenting our team's project
