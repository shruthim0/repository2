    <td class="tg-0pky">Q22: Two grids are shown below. Each grid contains a robot represented as a triangle. Both robots are initially facing left. Each robot can move into a white or gray square, but cannot move into a black region. For each grid, the program below is intended to move the robot to the gray square. The program uses the procedure Goal_Reached ( ), which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise.<br><br><img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/ac9883d1a0627c9576641df6168937cc/original.png" width="250" height="196"><img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/media.academicmerit.com/de3453c52e4929e254628b668fac74af/original.png" width="148" height="178"></td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">First choice was correct, but second was not. To remove the first 2 characters of oldString, this code segment takes a substring starting at position 3.

This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.<br><br>B (incorrect): As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n.

## Overall Comments
I did better on this MCQ than previous ones, but there are still some topics that I am not proficient in (Algorithmic Efficiency, Identifying Errors) and vocabulary I need to brush up on. I think by reviewing the AP Daily Videos, looking back at older lessons, and reviewing my vocab list will help me improve.
