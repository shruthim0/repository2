    <td class="tg-0pky">At first I thought the new number would only be 4 times the original because the the 2^0 place would'nt have any affect. But no, the effect it has is still 2^3</td>

## Questions I found easier
- Compared to previous times, the questions asked about what would be then nevt binary number, were much easier. 


## Questions I have
- I am not sure if I am taking too much time on the binary questions. Usually what I do is convert the given binary value to decimal, and then do the same for each anser choice until I get the decimal value I need. Is there a better way to approach these questions?
