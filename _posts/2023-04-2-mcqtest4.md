    <td class="tg-0pky">Which of the following is a characteristic of the fault-tolerant nature of routing on the Internet?</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The ability to resolve errors in domain name system (DNS) lookups<br>Explanation:The ability to resolve errors in DNS lookups is not affected by how packets are routed.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky">The ability to provide data transmission even when some connections have failed.<br>Explanation:Routers on the Internet are able to move packets through various paths to reach their final destination, even when some connections have failed. This characterizes the fault-tolerant nature of routing.</td>

    <td class="tg-0pky">A teacher stores the most recent quiz scores for her class in the list scores. The first element in the list holds the maximum possible number of points that can be awarded on the quiz, and each remaining element holds one student’s quiz score. Assume that scores contains at least two elements. Which of the following code segments will set the variable found to true if at least one student scored the maximum possible number of points on the quiz and will set found to false otherwise?</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"><img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR165588.g07.png" alt="Image" width="250" height="181"><br>Explanation:This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only the student scores to the maximum possible score. However, the code segment will fail to check the last element in the list. When index is equal to the length of the list, the loop will terminate without comparing the last student score in the list to the maximum possible score.</td>
    <td class="tg-0pky"><img src="https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/VR165588.g05.png" alt="Image" width="251" height="182"><br>Explanation: This code segment traverses the list beginning with the second element, so it is correctly comparing only student scores to the maximum possible score, which is found by accessing scores[1]. The variable found will only be set to true when a student’s score equals the maximum possible score. The code also sets the number of iterations to LENGTH(scores) - 1 to reflect that the first list element (maximum score) is skipped.</td>
