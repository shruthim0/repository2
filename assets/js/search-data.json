Procedure: is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values . Parameters: are input values of a procedure . Arguments: specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called . Procedural Abstraction: which provides a name for a process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it . What are some other names for procedures?: function . Why are procedures effective?: We have the ability to alter the result without actually changing the calls to the program. Convenient to change the actions if there is an error in the code (modularity). Able to break the code up and abstract what different part of the code does; helps identiy bugs, error, etc. MUCH better than reviewing code WITHOUT a procedure (you would have to look at every line by line) . Extra Notes . A procedure call interrupts a series of statements and makes the program execute the statements in the procedure. After executing, it will return to the original call and finish the statements. | in python, to call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure (there may not be parameters, but parenthesis must be there). | procedural abstraction: process that allows a procedure to be used only knowing WHAT it does, not HOW it does it. Have variable parameters | Code handles different situations depending on how its parameters are set/called | It allows a solution to a large problem based on the solutions of smaller subproblems. | Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent pieces or blocks, each containing all the parts needed to execute a single aspect of the functionality is called modularity | . | . function subtraction(a,b) { return a - b; } subtraction(10,12) . Challenge 1 below: Add the command that will call the procedure. . def dectobinary(decimal): binary = 0 i = 0 num = decimal while(num &gt; 0): binary = ((num%2)*(10**i)) + binary # set binary equal to remainder of the input/2, multiplied by 10^i num = int(num/2) #now number equal num/2 rounded to an integer i += 1 #incriment by 1 print(&quot;Your number &quot; + str(decimal) + &quot; in binary is &quot; + str(binary)) #output result decimal = 7 dectobinary(decimal) . Your number 7 in binary is 111 . Challenge 2 below: Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . a = int(input(&quot;Enter your first value&quot;)) b= int(input(&quot;Enter your second value?&quot;)) def function(a,b): if a &gt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the larger value!&quot;) print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the smaller value!&quot;) else: if b &gt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the larger value&quot;) print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the smaller value!&quot;) if b == a: print(str(a) + str(b) + &quot; (a and b) are equal&quot;) function(a,b) . 4 (b) is the larger value 1 (a) is the smaller value! . a = int(input(&quot;Enter your first value&quot;)) b= int(input(&quot;Enter your second value?&quot;)) def findMax(a,b): if a &gt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the larger value!&quot;) else : if b &gt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the larger value!&quot;) def findMin(a,b): if a &lt; b: print(str(a) + &quot; (a) is the smaller value!&quot;) else: if b &lt; a: print(str(b) + &quot; (b) is the smaller value!&quot;) findMax(a,b) findMin(a,b) . 4 (b) is the larger value! 1 (a) is the smaller value! . Homework/Hacks: For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . import math def charToBinary(term): char = [] binary = [] for x in term: char.append(ord(x)) #each character from APCSP is assigned to a list (char) for x in char: binary.append(int(bin(x)[2:])) #for each character in list char, the binary of that character is appended to binary list (I just used the built in bin conversion function) return binary #binary list is printed print(&quot; &#39;APCSP&#39; in binary is: &quot;) print(charToBinary(&quot;APCSP&quot;)) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get . &#39;APCSP&#39; in binary is: [1000001, 1010000, 1000011, 1010011, 1010000] .",

UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Titanic dataset is also available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a collection of datasets that are commonly used for machine learning research. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. . | Seaborn library: If you have the Seaborn library installed in your Python environment, you can load the Titanic dataset directly from the library using the following code: . import seaborn as sns titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) . | . | . Titanic Data . Look at a sample of data. . import seaborn as sns # Load the titanic dataset titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) print(&quot;Titanic Data&quot;) print(titanic_data.columns) # titanic data set print(titanic_data[[&#39;survived&#39;,&#39;pclass&#39;, &#39;sex&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;]]) # look at selected columns . Use Pandas to clean the data. Most analysis, like Machine Learning or even Pandas in general like data to be in standardized format. This is called &#39;Training&#39; or &#39;Cleaning&#39; data. . # Preprocess the data from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = titanic_data td.drop([&#39;alive&#39;, &#39;who&#39;, &#39;adult_male&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;, &#39;deck&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;alone&#39;] = td[&#39;alone&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0) # Encode categorical variables enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;) enc.fit(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]) onehot = enc.transform(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]).toarray() cols = [&#39;embarked_&#39; + val for val in enc.categories_[0]] td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot) td.drop([&#39;embarked&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) print(td) . The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. .

From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

My Hacks . 2.3 Questions . A researcher is analyzing data about students in a school district to determine whether there is a relationship between grade point average and number of absences. The researcher plans on compiling data from several sources to create a record for each student. | The researcher has access to a database with the following information about each student. . Last name First name Grade level (9, 10, 11, or 12) Grade point average (on a 0.0 to 4.0 scale) The researcher also has access to another database with the following information about each student. . First name Last name Number of absences from school Number of late arrivals to school . Upon compiling the data, the researcher identifies a problem due to the fact that neither data source uses a unique ID number for each student. Which of the following best describes the problem caused by the lack of unique ID numbers? . Answer: There will be many students at the school that share the same first name. Without a unique student ID, students with the same name may get confused with eachother. So if one student&#39;s GPA may get confused with anothers, which would cause the researcher&#39;s data and analysis to be incorrect. . A team of researchers wants to create a program to analyze the amount of pollution reported in roughly 3,000 counties across the United States. The program is intended to combine county data sets and then process the data. Which of the following is most likely to be a challenge in creating the program? | Answer: Combining multiple data sets requires the involved data sets to have similar structures and calculations. One county may calculate pollution in different units (per sq acre vs per sq mile) than another county. County datasets may also differ in the frequency of data present. One county may have data on pollution for every year, but onther county may conduct that reaseach monthly. . A student is creating a Web site that is intended to display information about a city based on a city name that a user enters in a text field. Which of the following are likely to be challenges associated with processing city names that users might provide as input? | Answer: Anytime when user&#39;s are able to manually type into a field, there is always a chance the data collected from that field has &quot;garbage&quot; in it. Users may spell the city name wrong, use an abbreviation, or use a city nickname. A more user friendly program would plan for events like there by, for example, not only having city names in their data, but also city abbreviations. . A database of information about shows at a concert venue contains the following information. | Name of artist performing at the show Date of show Total dollar amount of all tickets sold Which of the following additional pieces of information would be most useful in determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month? . Answer: The average proce of tickets would be the most helpful in determining the artist with the greatest attendence. The attendance for a specific show can be calculated by dividing the dollar amount of tickets sold by the average ticket price would give you how many people have bought tickets for that show. . A camera mounted on the dashboard of a car captures an image of the view from the driver’s seat every second. Each image is stored as data. Along with each image, the camera also captures and stores the car’s speed, the date and time, and the car’s GPS location as metadata. Which of the following can best be determined using only the data and none of the metadata? | Answer: Only a visual would show the number of bicycles the car passed. Neither the car’s speed, the date, time, or the car’s GPS location would be able to indicate the number of bicycles the care passed. . A teacher sends students an anonymous survey in order to learn more about the students’ work habits. The survey contains the following questions. | On average, how long does homework take you each night (in minutes) ? On average, how long do you study for each test (in minutes) ? Do you enjoy the subject material of this class (yes or no) ? Which of the following questions about the students who responded to the survey can the teacher answer by analyzing the survey results? . Do students who enjoy the subject material tend to spend more time on homework each night than the other students do? Do students who spend more time on homework each night tend to spend less time studying for tests than the other students do? Do students who spend more time studying for tests tend to earn higher grades in the class than the other students do? . Answer: Option 3 requires data outside of the survey, specifically the student&#39; grades. Both I and II only require data from within the survey. . 1990 vs. 2017 Carbon Emissions per Nation . Purpose: . The purpose of this dataset is to investigate the Carbon emissions for nations in 2017 vs in 1990. It allows people to see which nations increased in their emissions, which decreased, which nations are the greatest contibuters... I found a dataset on Kaggle, which had CO2 emissions for years 1990--&gt;2018. I created a json file, but only used the &quot;Country&quot; &quot;1990 Carbon Emissions&quot; and &quot;2017 Carbon Emissions.&quot; . import pandas as pd df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/co2em.json&#39;) print(df) #print raw .

Both robots are initially facing left. Each robot can move into a white or gray square, but cannot move into a black region. For each grid, the program below is intended to move the robot to the gray square. The program uses the procedure Goal_Reached ( ), which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise. | Neither grid I not grid II | Grid I only | In Grid I, the robot moves forward to the end of the bottom row, turns right twice, moves forward twice, turns right twice, moves forward until the end of the middle row, turns left twice, moves forward twice, turns left twice, and moves forward until Goal_Reached is true. | .

To remove the first 2 characters of oldString, this code segment takes a substring starting at position 3. To remove the last 2 characters of oldString, the substring ends at the position that is 4 characters less than the length of oldString (since 4 characters are removed). | . Q50: | Algorithms A and B | Algorithms A and D | D: The number of steps for this algorithm is equal to the length of the list squared, as the number of steps is equal to n2 for a list of size n. This is an example of a polynomial efficiency and indicates that the algorithm runs in a reasonable amount of time.B (incorrect): As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n for a list of size n. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time. | .

Allows people to develop healthier food habits. | Can help people recovering from eating disorders. | Gives people with food sensitivites or allergies more dietary options. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; | Harms of our Project . Could lead to some overly watching their diet. | Discourages eating from restaurants. If this program was used VERY widely could hurt small food businesses. | Privacy issues when entering personal information into site &lt;/br&gt; | Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . Yes, the dopamine issue is real. Dopamine is the same neurotransmitter that is released in you body when you use drugs. That’s how addiction is created. Your body requires more and more of that stimulant to reach that same level of dopamine from the first time. The same can be said for video games. &lt;/br&gt; &lt;/br&gt; | 5.2 Digital Divide . What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? By creating contributions that advance the digital aspects of our world. | How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. | Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? At a school, there are certain restrictions that just must be in place. In this case, the risk, student’s using the internet inappropriately is much higher that the reward of digital empowerment. &lt;/br&gt; | What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. . The digital divide prevalent in our world takes away more opportunities from those who have less access to technology and overall make their lives harder. We can even see this at school, where if you don’t have a smartphone you can’t use the qr codes clubs use for google forms or websites. . 5.3 Computing Bias . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Mostly the older generation uses Facebook while GenZ uses Tiktok. This is profitable for the individual companies as they are able to market goods to those specific groups. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . I think it’s connected to the idea that women are supposed to be traditionally be the “caretakers” so when a virtual asistant has a female voice it may make people feel like they are being taken care of. Which people may believe that women have a more soothing voice then men. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) . Netflix uses both user specific data and data from the general population, to keep users hooked on their platform. Like the “__% similar to your taste” category. . HP Computer Video: When not enough diverse data is used to train a program, it results in bias. In the HP video, they probably only used white faces when training their facial recognition program, so the program is unusable to any non-white person. . 5.4 Crowdsourcing . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? . Our project is about providing users with recipes. So, we could have a page where people are able to “like” or vote up/down each recipe. This would get data on the opinions APCS students have about recipes. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? . Del Norte has diverse individuals with different backgrounds and views. By using DNHS as our population, we can collect diverse data. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. . Our project is about providing users with recipes. So, we could have a page where people are able to “like” or vote up/down each recipe. This would get data on the opinions APCSP/APCSA students have about recipes. . 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. . Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to the world-wide public domain | . | Open Source MIT License allows people to use code freely, and making+distributing closed source versions closed source —&gt; so project on GitHub could be private | . | author can say credit needs to be given (could be just adding author’s name at end) | | . | Open Source GPL License allowes people to do ALMOST anything with the code, except distributing closed source versions open source —&gt; GitHub project must be public | . | . | Summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. . Software Licenses/Options An author needs to determine a license. | These questions should be asked when determinging which license should be chosen Do I want to waive default copyright in reuse? | Do I want to allow derivative works or not? | Do I want to require all derivative code to be shared? | | . | Digital Rights companies build DRM (Digital Rights Management) software to protect, play, and/or distribute content | . | Ethical Thoughts We need to comply with the terms of licenses and cite sources in our own projects | Many companies try to sites bypass this, but get shut down because of illegalities | . | Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. . Our team choose to use the ___ license for our frontend (datapirates GitHub repository) and ___ for our backend (dpbackend GitHub repository). We decided on these licenses because . 5.6 . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. . - When you create a public GitHub repository, with you name attached to it . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? . - It&#39;s always best to minimize your ouwn PII. The more personal information out there on the internet about you, the less safe you are. Digital footprints are also very key through life. When you have a job intervew often your digital footprint is examined. ### Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Good passwords have nothing significant about you in them (at least stuff that isn&#39;t obviously significant to you), are longer, have numbers and symbols, and are unique for each site. Bad passwords are the opposite, maybe they are short, only include your name... . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . - Symmetric: same key (a secret key) is used for encryption and decryption - Asummetric: different keys (one public key and one private key) is used for decryption than encryption . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. . - When you set us a GitHub repository you need to generate a SSH key and GPG key (I think). The SSH is for authentication and the GPG is for signing tags and commits . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. . - I know people whose Instagram accounts have been hacked. Their accounts are stolen, somebody poses as them, and posts false information (links that give viruses...). - Lots of phone call ones where they&#39;ll say stuff about a car warranty, or a stolen credit card, or that you won a free cruise, and then they&#39;ll ask for your ssn or credit card number :) .",

Take notes on vocabulary terms and concepts! Noor . Simulations are abstractions that mimic more complex objects or phenomenas from the real world, used for specific purposes Purposes include drawing inferences without the contraints of the real world | . | Simulations use varying sets of values to reflect the changing state of a real phenomenon | Often, when developing an abstract simulation, it is neccessary to remove specific deatils or simplify aspects. Simulations can often contain bias based on which details or real-world elements were included/excluded | . | Simulations allow the formulation and redinement of hypotheses under consideration | Variability and randomness of the world is considered using random number generators | Examples: rolling dice, spinners, molecular models, analyze chemicals/reactions... | . Analyzing an Example: Air-Traffic Simulator . Shruthi Say we want to find out what the optimal number of aircrafts that can be in the air in one area is. . A simulation allows us to explore this question without real world contraints of money, time, safety Unfortunately we can&#39;t just fly 67 planes all at once and see what happens | . | Since the simulation won&#39;t be able to take all variables into control, it may have a bias towards one answer | Will not always have the same result | .

Answer choices: . | 1: It uses a conditional to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met. | 2: It uses a REPEAT loop to run the same block of code multiple times. | 3: It simplifies a real-world scenario into something that can be modeled in code and executed on a computer. | 4: It does not request input from the user or display output to the user. | .

Okay, so we&#39;ve learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there&#39;s a more advanced program you don&#39;t know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. . You&#39;ve already learned about functions that you can write to reuse in your code in previous lessons. But,there are many others who code in python just like you. So why would you do again what someone has already done, and is available for any python user? . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most package come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick google search. methods are used with the following: . Note: a method from a package can only be used after the import statement. . Some methods are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word &quot;from&quot;, followed by the package name, then the word &quot;import&quot;, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package&#39;s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use &quot;*&quot;. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word &quot;as&quot;, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Challenge 1: Basic Libraries . Find a python package on the internet and import it | Choose a method from the package and import only the method | import the package as a more convenient name. | import math as m from math import * from math import sqrt . Challenge 2: Turtle . Turtle is a python drawing package which allows you to draw all kinds of different shapes. It&#39;s ofter used to teach beginning python learners, but is really cool to use anywhere. Turtle employs a graphics package to display what you&#39;ve done, but unfortunately it&#39;s kind of annoying to make work with vscode. Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Use: repl.it Click &quot;+ Create&quot;, and for language, select &quot;Python (with Turtle)&quot; Documentation Task: Have fun with turtle!

            "title": "Searching Introduction",
            "content": "What is searching? . In certain computer programs and applications, one might find the need to locate and retrieve a data value and/or it&#39;s index. Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example . This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the next power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the next, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? #ideally the code should prompt the user multiple times item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu&quot;) #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user price = menu.get(item.lower()) print(price) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 3.99 . Hacks . Now is a good time to think about Testing of your teams final project... . What errors may arise in your project? We may have caculation errors, errors that resulting in incorrect formatting for our game, or syntax errors. | What are some test cases that can be used? Running the code and seeing the result, altering different values and seeing the result. | Make sure to document any bugs you encounter and how you solved the problem. As Hack Design and Test plan action … Divide these “single” tests into Issues for Scrum Board prior to coding.

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[3]&quot;, langs[3], type(langs[3])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 18 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[3] Bash &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;John Doe&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 18, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;John&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Mortensen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;October 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2015-Fusion&quot;, &quot;2011-Ranger&quot;, &quot;2003-Excursion&quot;, &quot;1997-F350&quot;, &quot;1969-Cadillac&quot;] }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Append to List a 3rd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Shruthi&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Malayath&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;April 14&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;shmalayath@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;-&quot;] }) # Append to List a 4th Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Kavya&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Malayath&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 30th&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;kavyam@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;pls no&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = Quiz[i] print (record) i += 1 return while_loop() .
