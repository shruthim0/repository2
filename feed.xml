Program Purposeand Function 0 0 The student met the requirement because in their video they showed entering the input, the program is run, and the output is displayed. In their response, they clearly state the functionality and lists the inputs and outputs of the function. It DOES NOT state the purpose, only the what the function does. yes Data Abstraction 1 1 Includes code segment with a list and another segment where the code segment is being used. They correctly identify to list name as sideIndex, and describe what their list includes (different triangle classifications). yes Managing Complexity 0 0 Response is inaccurate when describing the importance of the list. Strings could just be used, if anything the list is unnecessary. yes Procedural Abstraction 1 1 Meets everything. ratioCalculate is the student-developed procedure, and is called in a second segment with the parameters A,B,C. yes Algorithm Implementation 1 1 Explains the code segment in detail. yes Testing 1 1 Describes two calls with different parameters and shows the output of both. yes]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Homework 3.17 - 3.18</title><link href="https://shruthim0.github.io/repository2/homework1718" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Homework 3.17 - 3.18" /><published>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2022-12-14T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://shruthim0.github.io/repository2/117-118-homework</id><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
