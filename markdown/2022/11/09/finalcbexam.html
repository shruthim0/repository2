</ul><p>Incorrect Questions + explanation</p>

<p>Overall Thoughts + Comments: In general I need to pay more attention while reading the question and identifying what the problem is asking me to find. For most of these questions, I solved for the wrong output/variable/etc. because I skimmed over the question instructions. Overall pay more attension while reading the question and make sure you’re actually answering the question.</p>

<p>2.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: It displays true if x is negative and displays false otherwise.</li>
  <li>correct answer: It displays true if x is negative and displays nothing otherwise.</li>
  <li>Explanation: When x is negative, y is assigned the value true and the value of y is displayed. When x is not negative, y is assigned the value false and the display statement is never executed. It WONT display false, just nothing will be displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>15.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: Users can identify and correct errors they encounter when using released versions of the software.</li>
  <li>correct answer: Users can provide feedback that can be used to incorporate a variety of perspectives into the software.</li>
  <li>Explanation: Users can provide feedback that can help inform program design and development. Information gathered from potential users can be used to understand the purpose of a program from diverse perspectives and to develop a program that fully incorporates these perspectives. I accidentally choose the wrong option.</li>
</ul>

<p>16.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: The message is broken into packets that are transmitted in a specified order. Each packet must be received in the order it was sent for the message to be correctly reassembled by the recipient’s device.</li>
  <li>correct answer:</li>
  <li>Explanation: Messages are broken into packets, BUT they can be received in any order and still be reassembled.</li>
</ul>

<p>24.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: Decimal 5, binary 1011, binary 1101, decimal 12</li>
  <li>correct answer: Decimal 5, binary 1011, decimal 12, binary 1101</li>
  <li>Explanation: Binary 1011 is equivalent to 23+21+20, or decimal 11, and binary 1101 is equivalent to 23+22+20, or decimal 13. The order of the numbers (written in their equivalent decimal format) is 5, 11, 12, 13.</li>
</ul>

<p>27.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: A string variable named s and a Boolean variable named a</li>
  <li>correct answer: A string variable named studentName and a Boolean variable named isAbsent</li>
  <li>Explanation: While a string variable and a Boolean variable are appropriate for this situation, the variable names s and a are not meaningful and will make the code segment harder for someone to read.</li>
</ul>

<p>28.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: B</li>
  <li>correct answer: C</li>
  <li>Explanation: If the number of units of electricity used is 25 or less, the cost is 5 times the number of units. Otherwise, the cost is 5 times the first 25 units plus 7 times the number of units above 25. For examples, if a customer used 32 units of electricity, they should be charged $5 for the first 25 and $7 for the additional 7 units (32 – 25 = 7 units), for a total charge of $174. THE FIRST 25 U ARE STILL CHARGED AS 5 PER U.</li>
</ul>

<p>32.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: [10, 30, 50, 70, 20, 40, 60, 80]</li>
  <li>correct answer: [10, 30, 50, 70]</li>
  <li>Explanation: List is not appended, a copy of myList is assigned to yourList.</li>
</ul>

<p>35.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: B &amp; D</li>
  <li>correct answer: A &amp; D</li>
  <li>Explanation:The last line in the code segment of B sets maxPS to 50 regardless of the value of time, which is incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<p>37.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: B</li>
  <li>correct answer: D</li>
  <li>Explanation: B assigns both variable as num1</li>
</ul>

<p>38.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer:
 A. temp  ←  word1</li>
</ul>

<p>word3  ←  word1</p>

<p>word1  ←  temp</p>

<ul>
  <li>correct answer:</li>
</ul>

<p>B. temp  ←  word1</p>

<p>word1  ←  word3</p>

<p>word3  ←  temp</p>

<ul>
  <li>Explanation: A makes xylophone both word1 and word3, which is incorrect.</li>
</ul>

<p>41.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: 30</li>
  <li>correct answer: 20</li>
  <li>Explanation: q and s are 30 after the coe is executed, but r is 20. R is assigned the value of p and p is 20.</li>
</ul>

<p>42.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: 18</li>
  <li>correct answer: 16</li>
  <li>Explanation: After initially assigning values to the variables, the code segment assigns the value 4 to num3 and assigns the value 8 to num1. The value of sum at the end of the code segment is 8 + 4 + 4, or 16.</li>
</ul>

<p>43.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: 10</li>
  <li>correct answer: 15</li>
  <li>Explanation: 10 would be if it was looped 4 times, not 5.</li>
</ul>

<p>44.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: 2</li>
  <li>correct answer: 3</li>
  <li>Explanation: The remainder when 23 is divided by 3 is 2, so 23 MOD 3 is 2. Question is asking what what y should be set to.</li>
</ul>

<p>46.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: The value of first is false, and the value of second is false.</li>
  <li>correct answer: The value of first is true, and the value of second is true.</li>
  <li>Explanation: The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d.</li>
</ul>

<p>47.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer:</li>
  <li>correct answer: Assigned d incorrectly.The eighth statement assigns the value of c + d / 2 (which is 50) to d.</li>
</ul>

<p>48.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer: The value of first is false, and the value of second is false.</li>
  <li>correct answer:The value of first is true, and the value of second is true.</li>
  <li>Explanation: Incorrect. The third statement assigns the value of first (which is true) to second. The fourth statement assigns the value of second (which is true) to first.</li>
</ul>

<p>49.</p>
<ul>
  <li>my answer:
word  ←  “no”</li>
</ul>

<p>word  ←  concat(reverse(word), reverse(word))</p>

<ul>
